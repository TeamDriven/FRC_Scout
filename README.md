ScoutingApp
===========
This is an iPad app designed to aid any and all FIRST Robotics teams in gathering vital scouting data on teams at regionals so that all teams can develop successful match strategies for any challenge that may present itself.

This app (in the end) should be able to:
 - Record all important actions of a single robot during a match
 - Display the recorded data for any saved robot in the system in an easy-to-read format
 - Sync all team iPads to save matches simultaniously as they are saved on each individual iPad (via Bluetooth)
 - Push and pull scouted data between a server and the app
 - Receive match schedules from the server once FIRST posts them and send a push notification to the user
